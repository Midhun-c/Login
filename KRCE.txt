“If you think you are beaten you are;If you think you dare not, you don't;
If you want to win but think you can’t;it’s almost a cinch you won’t.
If you think you;ll lose you're lost;
For out of the world we find Success begins with
afellow;swill; It’s all in a state of mind.
Life;s battles don;t always go to the stronger andfaster man,
But sooner orlater the man who winsIs the man who thinks he can “
